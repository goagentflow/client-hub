# Archive

Historical documents are kept here for traceability and context only.

Do not use archived files as implementation source-of-truth. For current behavior, use:

- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/README.md`

## Structure

- `feature-rollouts/`: completed feature rollout plans and feedback logs
- `legal-plans/`: completed/superseded legal implementation plans
- `middleware/`: superseded middleware auth implementation planning
- root `archive/`: legacy architecture research and earlier planning artifacts
